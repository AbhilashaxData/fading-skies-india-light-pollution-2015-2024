# 🌌 Fading Skies: India's Vanishing Stars (2015–2024)

### 📍 Mapping the Rise of Light Pollution and the Fall of Astronomical Visibility Across States

---

## 🔎 Project Overview

“Fading Skies” investigates the alarming spread of **light pollution** across Indian states from **2015 to 2024**, and how it affects **astronomical visibility**, **dark sky preservation**, and **ecological balance**.

With increasing urban expansion and artificial lighting, the natural night sky is rapidly disappearing, posing not just an aesthetic loss, but impacting biodiversity, human health, and indigenous cultural knowledge tied to the stars.

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

- India is **one of the top contributors** to global light pollution, yet domestic data awareness is low.
- Unlike air or water pollution, **light pollution is under-monitored**, especially in open-data formats.
- This project aims to visualize the **state-wise visibility collapse** and provide a **data-driven narrative** for environmental advocacy and awareness.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard visuals  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for data pre-processing and cleaning  
- **Simulated Dataset** – based on real-world indicators and trends

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Treemap** of Light Pollution Index average by State   
- **Ribbon Chart** showing visibility percentage fall across years  
- **Bar Chart** of Urban Light Growth vs Astro Visibility (2024 snapshot)  
- **Slicers** for multi-year and state comparison  
- **Cards** showing Astro Visibility score and light pollution index
- **Funnel chart** and **Matrix Heatmap**

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Light pollution has increased in **over 70% of Indian states** from 2015 to 2024.
- **Protected dark zones** remain stagnant or declined in many high-pollution areas.
- **West Bengal and Delhi** show stark imbalance through rising pollution with minimal preservation.
- **Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim** remain dark-sky strongholds, showing positive conservation trends.
- India’s night sky is fading at an alarming pace, posing threats to migratory species and cultural stargazing traditions.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

The stars have been silent witnesses to human history. It helped in navigating travellers, inspiring myths, guiding farmers, and fueling scientific quests. As artificial light overpowers nature’s rhythm, we risk severing this celestial connection. Through this visual narrative, “Fading Skies” invites us to pause, reflect, and protect what’s left of our shared nightscape.

Let’s keep the skies dark enough to dream.
